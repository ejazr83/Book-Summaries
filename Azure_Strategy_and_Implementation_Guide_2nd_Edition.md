# Azure Strategy and Implementation Guide - 2nd Edition: Summary Notes

This guide is intended to provide a solid foundation to plan and implement Azure as an organisations's cloud computing platform.

The book is divided into four main sections

1. Microsoft Azure Governance
2. Architecture
3. Application Development and Operations
4. Service Management

## Azure Governance

Azure Governance according to Microsoft has three components.

1. **Design**: This is a combination of the customer vision and constraints and provides the *Why do we this?* aspect.
2. **Execute**: These are the actual componenets and policies that are being implemented or the *How we do this?* part.
3. **Review**: This is making sure that the measures implemented are fullfilling the intended purpose in the Design phase or basically answering *Is this being done?*.

## Cloud Envisioning

The main context here is to provide the big picture around Digital Transformation and how having a vision for the orgnisation is necessary. Afterall, cloud technologies like Azure is just a tool to achive the vision and not just using technology for technologies sake. The strategy and context around Enterprise Cloud Strategy is explained in more detail in a seperate [ebook](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/enterprise-cloud-strategy/)

The key idea though is that Digital Transformation is covered over four main pillars

1. **Engage Customers**: Delivering rich experinces to delight your customers
2. **Empower Employees**: Increase flow of information across business, better manage resources and sync business processes
3. **Optimise Operations**: Increase efficiencies and improve products and services
4. **Transform Products**: Anticipate customer needs and provide innovative products to meet their demand as fast as possible
