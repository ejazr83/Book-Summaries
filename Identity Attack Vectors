# Identity Attack Vectors - 2019 - O-reilly

### By Morey Haber and Darren Rolls

## Three Pillars of CyberSecurity
  1. Identity
    - Human or Machine
    - Trusted or Untrusted
    - Business or Tech role
    - Entitlement reporting
    - Inception or revocation
    
  2. Privilege
    - Admin vs Root vs Standard user
    - Least privilidge
    - Priv id mgmt
    - Session mgmt
    - Directory bridging with shared or local accounts
    - Reporting and Analytics
    
  3. Asset
    - Vulnerability Management
    - Patch Management
    - Configuration Management
    - Regulatory Compliance
    - Threat and Risk reporting
    


##Lateral Movement##

Resources | Privileged Attack Vector | Asset Attack Vector
Operating system | Credential, certifcates, or hash-based attacks | Vulnerabilities, exploits, and misconfigurations
Applications | Credential, certifcates, or application-to-application attacks | Vulnerabilities, exploits, misconfigurations, insecure architectures, and end of life
Containers | Credential, certifcates, or insecure connectivity (lack of zero trust) | Vulnerabilities, exploits, misconfigurations, insecure architectures, and agile DevOps
Virtual machines | Credential or hash- or hypervisor-based credential attacks | Vulnerabilities, exploits, misconfigurations, insecure architectures and agile DevOps, and CPU- and memory-based vulnerabilities
Accounts | Credential theft or abuse or identity theft | Credential theft, abuse, memory-scraping, and insecure credential storage 
Identities | Credential reuse, credential theft | Inappropriate account linkage
