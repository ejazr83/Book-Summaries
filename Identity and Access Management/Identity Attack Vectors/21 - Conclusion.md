Critical Tenets of Identity Attack vectors and how IAM should be embraced to make you implementation successful:

1. Think Identity and not Account
    * End users tend to have multiple accounts that gives them access to various systems and applications
    * Manage all these different accounts as part of one identity to tie it back to a human
    * Focus on getting visibility needed to properly answer " who has access to what "

2. Visibility is King --> Silos are Bad!
    * All systems that contain valuable or sensitive data or process mission critical functions should be managed with a focus on automation and compliance
    * Single point of visibility should allow the organization to leverage common detective and preventative controls
    * Enterprise wide view of its identity and access data

3. Full Lifecycle governance is a requirement
    * Manage lifecycle of identity and access to the business policies and owners responsible for it
    * Process should include Joiner, Mover, Leaver as well as access request, provisioning and access reviews

4. Deploy Integrated Privileged Access Management
    * Comprehensive approach to vaulting, auditing and monitoring of privileged credentials
    * Integrate PAM with Identity governance --> do not keep them in separate silos

5. Adopt a predictive approach
    * Embrace Machine Learning / AI to help security staff and compliance teams as well as broader business community to make more informed access decisions
    * Integrate insights and recommendations into you identity governance process flow to make better access certification decisions and smarter controls

6. Implement least privilege
    * Continuously drive towards a least privilege approach
    * Design smaller and more granular password vaults and fine grained entitlements
    * Adopt a more agile and responsive approach to assignments and removal of access

7. User Experience is everything !
    * Identity governance and privilege management should provide a better user experience
    * UX is essential part of having  widespread participation and adoption of Identity governance program
