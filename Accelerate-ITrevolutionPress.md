# 24 Key capabilities for a Technology company 

### Continunous Delivery
1. Use Version Control for all production artifacts
2. Automate your deployment process
3. Implement continuous integration - code regularly checked-in and run against tests to discover issues early and fix immediately
4. Use Trunk-based development: Fewer than three active branches. Short lifetimes where code is merged back into master
5. Implement Test automation  - developers are primarily responsible for creation and maintenance of automated test suites
6. Support Test data management - have adequate test data, ability to acquire tests data on demand, condition data in a pipeline, data should not limit the amount of tests you can run. Although amount of test data required should be minimised
7. Shift Left on Security - 
8. Implement continuous delivery (CD) - software should be in deployable state at any time
