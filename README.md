# Book-Summaries
Book Summaries that I have read and hopefully will help others

The main idea is to provide brief summaries for re-cap or skim through these books and use a reference to come back when needed.

Books covered range from Technology and vendor specific to strategy, leadership, advocacy and partnership and product and workflow management
